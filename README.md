# COVID-19-Detection

Detection of COVID-19 From X-ray images Using Deep
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

 Introduction:
 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.About 3 million people have been suffering from this pandemic .Among several ways for detection, I tried two approaches using X-ray and CT-scan. I suppose using them  is a faster, easier and less harmful method than others.Lungs of those patients(infected from Covid) were  presented with patchy ground glass opacities,crazy paving appearances and air space consolidation.

This is a standard Convolutional neural network model for detecting covid-19 from X-ray and CT-scan.

Datasets:
Datasets are collected from several sources. Two categories of data were collected for training and testing:x-ray and CT-Scan. X-ray non covid(normal and pneumonia) data were garnered through kaggle whereas X-ray covid-19 datasets are extracted from the github open source. CT-Scan datasets,whereas,both covid as well non covid, were fetched from github open source.
  


              Non-covid images                                                           covid-19 infected images

Data augmentation:

Due to less number of covid-19 positive images, images were augmentated by using the operations of horizontal and vertical flipping and rotation.

Approach:

Several standard models like VGG16,ResNet50,InceptionV3 have been implemented for transfer learning.Among them, VGG-16 gave the best result. Due to some limitation of data (Noise and small) different methods have to be followed.  

At first, X-ray data was trained in a standard pretrained model by freezing some layers.Almost 97% percent training accuracy and 98% of validation accuracy was achieved.After that CT scans-data was also trained on the pretrained model of x rays.

Result:

   Confusion matrix as well precesson table is shown below.
